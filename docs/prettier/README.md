# Usage of `.prettierrc`

## Introduction

Prettier is a code formatter that helps maintain consistent code style across your project. The `.prettierrc` file is a configuration file where you specify your Prettier settings.

## Setting Up `.prettierrc`

1. **Compatibility `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` with other Prettier plugins**

This plugin uses Prettier APIs that can only be used by one plugin at a time, making it incompatible with other Prettier plugins implemented the same way. To solve this we've added explicit per-plugin workarounds that enable compatibility with the following Prettier plugins:

- `@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports`
- `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`

One limitation with this approach is that `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` _must_ be loaded last.

```json5
// .prettierrc
{
  // ..
  plugins: [
    "@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports",
    "prettier-plugin-tailwindcss" // MUST come last
  ]
  // ..
}
```

Also, if you use vscode, only the tailwindcss plugin will work on save (command + s) and the rest of the plugins will work after running `yarn prettier:fix`.

However, all plugins may work correctly on the save (ctrl/command + s). I guess it depends on their versions.
