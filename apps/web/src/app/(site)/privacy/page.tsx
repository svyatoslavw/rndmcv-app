          We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express
          consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where
          your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at

          In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process
          your information without your consent, including, for example:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-4 list-inside list-disc">
          <li>
            If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be
            obtained in a timely way
          </li>
          <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
          <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
          <li>
            If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess,
            process, or settle an insurance claim
          </li>
          <li>
            For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
          </li>
          <li>
            If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of
            financial abuse

          <li>
            If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the
            availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for
            purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the
            laws of Canada or a province
          </li>
          <li>
            If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of
            the court relating to the production of records
          </li>
          <li>
            If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or
            profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information
            was produced
          </li>
          <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
